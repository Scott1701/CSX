Hi Scott here from Team Lehman Brothers!

We have tried to make a front-end that was user friendly to ensure good UIUX & Front-End Development Practices but found that it was really hard as two business students.

Despite our lack of programming experience, we have learnt how to code in solidity a smart contract to show at least in the feasibility section that such a technology exists to reinforce our idea!

So enjoy this cat!
